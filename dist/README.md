# drum-vagrant/dist

This is the directory that holds the tarballs for some of the applications
needed to run DRUM. At a minimum, you must download an Oracle JDK into this
directory (see [the main README](../README.md) for more information).

All \*.tar.gz files in this directory are [ignored by git](../.gitignore).
